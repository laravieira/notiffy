# Notiffy
Notiffy is a daily mail newsletter that uses PHP 8.

### Where is it?
[notiffy.laravieira.me](https://notiffy.laravieira.me)

### I'm subscribed, how I cancel it?
At the footer of a newsletter email that you received there is a unsubscribe button, just click it.

### How it works
It implements scrapping methods based on cURL and string manipulation.

### Doesn't you bother the sources?
For each use to search the news dozens of requests need to be made per page accessed. Notiffy only needs the raw html, meaning 1 request/day/page.

The only downside side of Notiffy to the sources is decrease quality on SEO score.

## Disclaim
This is a no offensive scraper script, all the data send by it is well directed to the source, the only information needed from an user is its email address and is only used to send the newsletter, you can cancel a subscription at any moment.

On the footer of each newsletter email has the source link of all the content shown on the newsletter.
